For more information go to https://developer.oculus.com.</li> </ol> <ul> <li>“Oculus Platform Framework” means the suite of Oculus platform services, including but not limited to the Oculus file distribution and update system (enabling distribution and updates of Developer Content by Oculus, including through generated activation Keys), entitlement system, and account authentication, which list may be changed from time to time in Oculus’ sole discretion.</li> <li>“Application Services” means services provided by Oculus associated with the Platform, including but not limited to in-app purchasing, multiplayer matchmaking, friends, leader boards, achievements, rooms, voice over IP and cloud saves, which list may be changed from time to time in Oculus’ sole discretion.</li> <li>“Platform” means the Oculus virtual reality platform, including but not limited to the user experience, user interface, store, and social features, usable on Oculus approved hardware or any third-party device or operating system, including but not limited to iOS, Android, Windows, OS X, Linux, and Windows Mobile.</li> <li> <p>“Platform Services” means the Oculus Platform Framework and the Application Services.</p> <p>3.1 Oculus Platform Services. Oculus makes certain Platform Services available to you to include and enable in your Developer Content.

Once your Developer Content has been authorized for use of the Platform Services, you are not required to update your Developer Content to include new Platform Services Oculus may make available as part of the Oculus Platform Framework.</p> <p>3.2 Limited Authorization. You hereby grant Oculus the limited authorization reasonably necessary for Oculus’s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under this Section 3.

Oculus agrees to authenticate and make Developer Content available to any end user supplying a valid Key (unless the Developer Content has been removed or withdrawn).</p> <p>3.5 Platform Services Requirements. You will not make any use of any API, software, code or other item or information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Services other than to enhance the functionality of your Developer Content. In particular, you must not (nor enable others to): (i) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others, or to promote or facilitate any prohibited or illegal activities; (ii) enable any functionality in your Developer Content that would generate excessive traffic over the Oculus network or servers that would negatively impact other users’ experience, or otherwise interfere with or restrict the operation of the Platform Services, or Oculus’s servers or networks providing the Platform Services; or (iii) remove, obscure, or alter any Oculus license terms, policies or terms of service or any links to or notices thereto. You may not sublicense any software, firmware or other item or information supplied by Oculus in connection with the Platform Service for use by a third party, unless expressly authorized by Oculus to do so.

You will not collect end users’ content or information, or otherwise access any Oculus site, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without Oculus’ prior permission.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of itself and for all Developer Content created as of March 28, 2016, may be evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the Oculus SDK, or acceptance of the license agreement. As this License is updated for future releases of the Oculus SDK, you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this License for those future Oculus SDK releases, with acceptance evidenced by usage of the Oculus SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License will apply for that future Developer Content that may be developed for or with that future Oculus SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against an older release of the Oculus SDK or License).</p> </li> <li> <p>Oculus reserves the right to terminate this License and all your rights hereunder immediately in the event you materially breach this License.</p> </li> <li> <p>Furthermore, Oculus also reserves the right to cancel or terminate this License for any of the following reasons:</p> </li> </ol> <p>a.

Oculus may assign its rights or obligations under this License in its sole discretion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this License will not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect money damages, if any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other equitable relief.</p> </li> <li> <p>You will comply, and will not cause Oculus to not comply (by for example, providing Developer Content to Oculus under this Agreement for which required export clearances have not been obtained), with all applicable export control laws of the United States and any other applicable governmental authority, including without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. You agree that this License and the Oculus SDK and accompanying documentation are Oculus’s confidential information (and is not publicly available), and you will not use it, disclose it or make it available to others except in accordance with the terms of this License.</p> </li> <li> <p>This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to conflict of laws provisions or principles thereof. The parties agree that, except as provided below, all disputes relating to this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration before a single neutral arbitrator in San Francisco, California. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator who is an attorney-at- law with at least fifteen (15) years’ experience in consumer and technology transactions and who is also a member of the JAMS roster of arbitrators. If You and Oculus cannot agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the arbitration is initiated, then JAMS will pick a neutral arbitrator who meets such qualifications. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority. You and Oculus agree the following may be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction located within San Francisco, California and further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco, California in connection with (a) any entrance of an arbitrator’s judgment or decision, (b) any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure, (c) Oculus’ exercise of any of its equitable rights or remedies or (d) any claims regarding the ownership, validity, enforceability and/or infringement of any intellectual property rights.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="opus-used-by-allonet"> <a href="#opus-used-by-allonet" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="opus-used-by-allonet"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> opus (used by allonet) </h2> <p>Copyright 2001-2011 Xiph.Org, Skype Limited, Octasic, Jean-Marc Valin, Timothy B.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Statement of Purpose</p> <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).</p> <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</p> <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p> <ol> <li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:</li> </ol> <p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p> </li> </ol> <p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d.
